unit unit_image_sharpness;
{Measurement of image sharpness for astronomical images of the Moon, Sun and stars}
{Resulting value is used for autofocus of Moon and Sun.}
{The routine applies the Root mean Square on the differences between the minimum and maximum value of each 2x2 pixel combination of the image.}
{The result is reversed and scaled such that the final result is roughly identical to the star HFD measurement.}
