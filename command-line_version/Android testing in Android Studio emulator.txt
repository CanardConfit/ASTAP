A possible path of some testing:

If you don’t have a real phone:

Run an emulator from Android Studio. Note the x86_64 emulator running Android 11 or higher will run both X86_64 and arm64/aarch64 programs!
Open Android Studio → Device Manager.
Create a Virtual Device (AVD) (e.g., Pixel 9, Android 16).
Select "Pre-release 16kb page Size Google Play intel x86_64 Atom system image"
Wait till installed.
Start the installed emulator.

Open a terminal in Android studio, note the path.
Open a CMD in Windows and go to the same path

Test adb with a temporary PATH (only for this CMD window)
   set PATH=%PATH%;E:\Android_sdk\platform-tools

Make sure adb itself is working
  adb version


In a CMD window, run:
   adb devices
You should see something like:
   emulator-5554   device



Deploy to Android X86_64 emulator:

   adb push astap_cli /data/local/tmp/
   adb shell chmod +x /data/local/tmp/astap_cli
   adb shell /data/local/tmp/astap_cli

Test solving, by copy the database and an image to the phone emulator:
   for %f in (E:\MyApplication2\d50*.*) do adb push "%f" /data/local/tmp/
   adb push m16.fits /data/local/tmp/

Test the solving:
   adb shell  /data/local/tmp/astap_cli -f  /data/local/tmp/m16.fits



extra:
Check runtime page size via ADB:
   adb shell getconf PAGE_SIZE

It should return 16384 on a 16 KB setup or 4096 otherwise.
